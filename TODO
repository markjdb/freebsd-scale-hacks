- Implement batch pagequeue insertion for "dontneed" pages.
  - Cleanest way to do this is probably to make a dedicated
    INACT_NOLRU pagequeue for them. Then we'll get batch queues
    automatically.
    This will require changes to the inactive queue scan.
- Add a reserv link lock to protect per-object reservation lists
  and the global reserv LRU queues.
  - Lock ordering gets tricky.
- Fuzzy counters.
  - vmmeter should be split into true counters vs. values that
    are compared with thresholds (e.g. v_wire_count)
- Taskqueue for removing pages from the active queue. A dedicated thread
  will introduce less lock contention on the active queue.
  - Maybe the pagedaemon should be responsible for this instead?
